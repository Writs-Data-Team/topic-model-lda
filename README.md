## Introduction
In order to better understand the granularity and specifics of the petitions dataset, topic modelling is an obvious choice. There are several ways to go about this - clustering over generated embeddings from transformer based models or rather rudimentary unsupervised algorithm like the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). A specific 'k' i.e. number of topics is specified and the algorithm tries to create k subgroups over the set.

## Methodology

### 1. Stopwording

Certain words need to be excluded from the model training set. A basic set of english words to filter out can be imported from nltk. For our use case, it was much more specific.

This set of legal words is defined under `legal_stop= {}`. The final set as found in `optimized-lda.py` is the result of an iterative process of training models multiple times and seeing what words are unnecessarily repeated.

With care, we can also use LLMs to generate a set of words. This set should only used contextually.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

nltk.download('stopwords', quiet=True)
base_stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Legal-specific stopwords
legal_stop = {
    # Parties and legal actors
    "court", "judge", "justice", "plaintiff", "defendant", "appellant", "appellee",
    "respondent", "petitioner", "prosecutor", "defense", "counsel", "attorney", "attorneys",
    "lawyer", "firm", "litigant", "party", "parties", "represent", "representation",
    
    # Legal process and documents
    "petition", "brief", "writ", "writs", "opinion", "decision", "dissent", "concurrence",
    "judgment", "order", "motion", "motions", "plea", "pleaded", "pleading", "filing",
    # ... (additional categories as defined in the code)
}

stop_words = base_stop | legal_stop
```

The comprehensive legal stopword set includes several categories:

- **Parties and legal actors**: court, judge, justice, plaintiff, defendant, appellant, appellee, respondent, petitioner, prosecutor, defense, counsel, attorney, attorneys, lawyer, firm, litigant, party, parties, represent, representation

- **Legal process and documents**: petition, brief, writ, writs, opinion, decision, dissent, concurrence, judgment, order, motion, motions, plea, pleaded, pleading, filing, filed, record, docket, summary, memorandum, transcript, statement, testimony, exhibit, appendix, page, pages, volume, footnote, note, citation, citations

- **Court actions and outcomes**: certiorari, remand, dismiss, affirm, reverse, vacate, rehearing, injunction, sentence, sentencing, verdict, arraignment, indictment, conviction, acquittal, retrial, mistrial, stay, reversal, hearing, trial, review, jurisdiction

- **Legal theory and doctrines**: holding, dicta, precedent, jurisprudence, standard, burden, test, mens rea, actus reus, prima facie, res judicata, stare decisis, legal, illegal, unlawful, liability, negligence, tort, contract, damages, injury, harm, equity, remedy, estoppel, waiver, doctrine

- **Legal language and Latin phrases**: habeas corpus, ex parte, en banc, voir dire, nolo contendere, amicus curiae, per curiam, de facto, de jure, inter alia, ipso facto, ultra vires, sine qua non, pro se, in re, sub judice

### 2. Loading Documents

Knowing compute resources and their magnitude is important. We had access to 256 GB of memory permitting loading all documents into memory directly. Otherwise batch sizing should be practiced.

```python
PARQUET_PATH = "/media/f1_drive/CorrelationCode/all_years_petitions_text_noIFP.parquet"
TEXT_COL = "text"

print("Loading all documents into memory...")
df_original = pd.read_parquet(PARQUET_PATH)
df_original = df_original.dropna(subset=[TEXT_COL]).reset_index(drop=True)
print(f"Loaded {len(df_original)} documents with non-null text")

# Track original indices for later alignment
df_original['original_index'] = df_original.index
texts = df_original[TEXT_COL].astype(str).tolist()
```

The dataset is loaded from a parquet file containing all years of SCOTUS petitions text (excluding In Forma Pauperis petitions). The pipeline handles approximately 50,000+ documents with non-null text content.

### 3. Text Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline consists of several critical stages:

#### 3.1 Boilerplate Cleaning
A specialized `clean_boilerplate()` function removes legal document artifacts:

```python
def clean_boilerplate(text):
    # Remove case numbers (e.g., "No. 12345")
    text = re.sub(r"No\.?\s*\d{1,6}(?:[-–]\d{1,6})?", "", text)
    # Remove U.S. citation formats (e.g., "U.S. 123")
    text = re.sub(r"U\.?S\.?\s*\d+", "", text)
    # Remove standard petition headers
    text = re.sub(r"(?si)^.*?(JOINT\s+PETITION\s+FOR\s+A\s+WRIT\s+OF\s+CERTIORARI)", "", text)
    return text
```

- Case numbers (e.g., "No. 12345")
- U.S. citation formats (e.g., "U.S. 123")
- Standard petition headers and formatting

#### 3.2 Pre-tokenization
The `pre_tokenize()` function performs:

```python
def pre_tokenize(text, min_len=3):
    if len(text) > 5_000_000:  # Increased limit for high memory
        text = text[:5_000_000]
    t = clean_boilerplate(text)
    t = re.sub(r"[^A-Za-z]", " ", t).lower()
    toks = simple_preprocess(t, deacc=True, min_len=min_len)
    return [w for w in toks if w not in stop_words]

# Apply pre-tokenization
print("Pre-tokenizing (removing stopwords, cleaning)...")
pre_tokenized = [pre_tokenize(text) for text in tqdm(texts)]
```

- Text length limiting (5 million characters for high-memory systems)
- Regex-based cleaning to remove non-alphabetic characters
- Conversion to lowercase
- Simple preprocessing using Gensim's `simple_preprocess`
- Initial stopword removal

#### 3.3 Multi-stage Filtering
The pipeline implements three filtering stages to ensure data quality:

```python
# Stage 1: Filter after pre-tokenization
print("Filtering after pre-tokenization...")
valid_indices_1 = [i for i, doc in enumerate(pre_tokenized) if len(doc) >= 5]
pre_tokenized = [pre_tokenized[i] for i in valid_indices_1]
df_working = df_original.iloc[valid_indices_1].copy().reset_index(drop=True)

# Stage 2: Filter after lemmatization (shown later in pipeline)
# Stage 3: Filter after n-gram processing (shown later in pipeline)
```

1. **Post pre-tokenization filtering**: Removes documents with fewer than 5 tokens
2. **Post lemmatization filtering**: Removes documents with fewer than 5 lemmatized tokens  
3. **Post n-gram processing filtering**: Final removal of documents with insufficient content

### 4. Advanced Text Processing

#### 4.1 Lemmatization with Multiprocessing
The pipeline uses spaCy for lemmatization with optimized multiprocessing:

```python
def init_worker():
    """Initialize spaCy model in each worker process"""
    global worker_nlp
    import spacy
    worker_nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm', disable=['parser','ner'])
    worker_nlp.max_length = 10_000_000

def lemmatize_doc_worker(doc):
    """Worker function that uses the process-local spaCy model"""
    spacy_doc = worker_nlp(doc)
    return [tok.lemma_ for tok in spacy_doc if tok.lemma_ not in stop_words]

# Multiprocessing lemmatization
with multiprocessing.Pool(
    processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count(),  
    initializer=init_worker
) as pool:
    documents = list(tqdm(
        pool.imap(lemmatize_doc_worker, docs_for_spacy, chunksize=200),  
        total=len(docs_for_spacy),
        desc="Lemmatizing"
    ))
```

- Utilizes all available CPU cores
- Process-local spaCy model initialization to avoid serialization overhead
- Chunked processing (200 documents per chunk) for memory efficiency
- Progress tracking with tqdm

#### 4.2 N-gram Detection
Bigram and trigram phrase detection using Gensim's Phrases:

```python
# Build bigrams and trigrams 
print("Building bigrams and trigrams...")
bigram  = Phrases(documents, min_count=50, threshold=10)
bigram_mod = Phraser(bigram)
trigram = Phrases(bigram[documents], min_count=25, threshold=10)
trigram_mod = Phraser(trigram)
documents = [trigram_mod[bigram_mod[doc]] for doc in documents]
```

- **Bigrams**: minimum count of 50, threshold of 10
- **Trigrams**: minimum count of 25, threshold of 10
- Sequential application: trigrams built from bigram-processed documents

### 5. Dictionary and Corpus Construction

#### 5.1 Dictionary Filtering
The Gensim Dictionary applies extreme filtering:

```python
# Build dictionary and corpus
print("Building dictionary and corpus...")
dictionary = Dictionary(documents)
dictionary.filter_extremes(no_below=20, no_above=0.3)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in documents]
print(f"Dictionary size after filtering: {len(dictionary)} tokens")

# Save dictionary and corpus for reuse
dictionary.save("data/dictionary.gensim")
with open("data/corpus.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(corpus, f)
```

- `no_below=20`: Remove tokens appearing in fewer than 20 documents
- `no_above=0.3`: Remove tokens appearing in more than 30% of documents
- This balances between removing rare noise and overly common terms

#### 5.2 Corpus Creation
Documents are converted to bag-of-words representation using the filtered dictionary, creating the final corpus for LDA training.

### 6. LDA Model Training

#### 6.1 Model Parameters
The pipeline trains multiple LDA models with different topic numbers (k = 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20):

```python
topic_nums = [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
passes = 20 
eval_every = 1
workers = multiprocessing.cpu_count()  

lda_models = {}

for k in topic_nums:
    print(f"\nTraining LdaMulticore with k={k} topics…")
    lda = LdaMulticore(
        corpus=corpus,
        id2word=dictionary,
        num_topics=k,
        passes=passes,
        eval_every=eval_every,
        workers=workers,
        random_state=42,
        alpha='asymmetric',
        eta='auto'
    )
    lda_models[k] = lda
    
    # Save model
    lda.save(f"data/lda_model_k{k}.gensim")
```

- **Algorithm**: LdaMulticore for parallel processing
- **Passes**: 20 iterations over the corpus
- **Workers**: All available CPU cores
- **Alpha**: 'asymmetric' (allows topics to have different prevalences)
- **Eta**: 'auto' (automatic prior estimation for topic-word distributions)
- **Random state**: 42 (for reproducibility)

#### 6.2 Model Evaluation and Output

For each k value, the pipeline generates:

```python
# Save top words per topic
with open(f"data/top_words_k{k}.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for idx, topic in lda.show_topics(num_topics=k, num_words=10, formatted=False):
        line = f"Topic {idx}: {', '.join([w for w,_ in topic])}\n"
        print(line.strip())
        f.write(line)

# Generate pyLDAvis visualization
try:
    vis = pyLDAvis.gensim_models.prepare(lda, corpus, dictionary, sort_topics=False)
    pyLDAvis.save_html(vis, f"data/pyldavis_k{k}.html")
    print(f"Saved pyLDAvis visualization to data/pyldavis_k{k}.html")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"pyLDAvis failed for k={k}: {e}")
```

1. **Model persistence**: Saved Gensim LDA models
2. **Topic summaries**: Top 10 words per topic in text files
3. **Interactive visualizations**: pyLDAvis HTML files for topic exploration
4. **Document-topic assignments**: Dominant topic and probability for each document

### 7. Topic Assignment and Analysis

#### 7.1 Dominant Topic Extraction
The `get_dominant_topic()` function:

```python
def get_dominant_topic(lda_model, corpus):
    """Get dominant topic for each document"""
    dominant_topics = []
    topic_probs_list = []
    
    for bow in corpus:
        topic_probs = lda_model.get_document_topics(bow)
        if topic_probs:
            dominant_topic = max(topic_probs, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
            max_prob = max(topic_probs, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
        else:
            dominant_topic = -1
            max_prob = 0.0
            
        dominant_topics.append(dominant_topic)
        topic_probs_list.append(max_prob)
    
    return dominant_topics, topic_probs_list

# Apply topic assignment
topics, probs = get_dominant_topic(lda, corpus)
```

- Extracts topic probability distributions for each document
- Assigns the highest-probability topic as the dominant topic
- Records the maximum probability score for confidence assessment

#### 7.2 Data Integration
Topic assignments are integrated back into the original dataset structure:

```python
# Add topic assignments to main dataframe
df_final[f'topic_k{k}'] = topics
df_final[f'topic_k{k}_prob'] = probs

# Create individual k DataFrame
base_columns = [col for col in df_final.columns if not col.startswith('topic_')]
df_individual = df_final[base_columns].copy()
df_individual['topic'] = topics
df_individual['topic_prob'] = probs

# Save individual parquet
df_individual.to_parquet(f'data/petitions_k{k}.parquet', index=False)

# Sample verification
print(f"Sample topic assignments for k={k}:")
for i in range(min(5, len(df_final))):
    print(f"  Doc {i} (orig_idx {df_final.iloc[i]['original_index']}): Topic {topics[i]} (prob: {probs[i]:.3f})")
```

- Multiple topic assignment columns for different k values
- Probability scores for assignment confidence
- Preservation of original document indices for traceability

### 8. Output Generation

The pipeline produces comprehensive outputs:

```python
# Save main parquet with all k topic assignments
df_final.to_parquet(f'data/petitions_with_topics_allk.parquet', index=False)

# Create index mapping for traceability
index_mapping = df_final[['original_index']].copy()
index_mapping['final_index'] = index_mapping.index
index_mapping.to_csv('data/index_mapping.csv', index=False)

# Final output summary
print("\nOUTPUT FILES:")
print("Model files:")
for k in topic_nums:
    print(f"  - data/lda_model_k{k}.gensim")
    print(f"  - data/petitions_k{k}.parquet")
    print(f"  - data/top_words_k{k}.txt")
    print(f"  - data/pyldavis_k{k}.html")
print("  - data/petitions_with_topics_allk.parquet")
print("  - data/dictionary.gensim")
print("  - data/corpus.pkl")
print("  - data/index_mapping.csv")
```

#### 8.1 Model Artifacts
- **Individual models**: `lda_model_k{k}.gensim` for each topic count
- **Dictionary and corpus**: Reusable preprocessing artifacts
- **Topic word lists**: Human-readable topic summaries

#### 8.2 Dataset Outputs
- **Individual datasets**: Separate parquet files for each k value
- **Comprehensive dataset**: Single file with all topic assignments
- **Index mapping**: CSV tracking document filtering process

#### 8.3 Visualizations
- **pyLDAvis**: Interactive topic model exploration
- **Topic coherence**: Implicit evaluation through multiple k values

### 9. Quality Assurance and Validation

#### 9.1 Alignment Verification
The pipeline includes multiple assertion checks:

```python
# Verify alignment across all processing stages
print(f"Documents list length: {len(documents)}")
print(f"Texts list length: {len(texts)}")
print(f"DataFrame length: {len(df_final)}")
assert len(documents) == len(texts) == len(df_final), "Alignment error!"

# Final verification
print(f"\nFinal verification:")
print(f"Main DataFrame shape: {df_final.shape}")
print(f"Number of unique original indices: {df_final['original_index'].nunique()}")
print(f"Topic assignment columns: {[col for col in df_final.columns if col.startswith('topic_')]}")
```

- Document count consistency across processing stages
- Index alignment between text lists and DataFrames
- Sample output verification for each model

#### 9.2 Iterative Refinement
The stopword list represents iterative refinement:
- Multiple training runs with different stopword configurations
- Manual inspection of topic outputs
- Addition of domain-specific terms that added noise

## Results and Applications

The final pipeline produces topic models suitable for:
- **Legal document classification**: Automated categorization of petition types
- **Trend analysis**: Temporal patterns in legal issues before SCOTUS
- **Comparative analysis**: Different granularities of topic assignment (k=14 to k=20)
- **Research applications**: Foundation for downstream legal analytics


## Conclusion

This LDA implementation provides a robust, scalable approach to topic modeling for legal document corpora. The extensive preprocessing, domain-specific stopword curation, and multi-model approach ensure both quality and flexibility in topic discovery for Supreme Court petition analysis. The pipeline's modular design allows for easy adaptation to other legal document collections or modification of hyperparameters for different analytical needs.
